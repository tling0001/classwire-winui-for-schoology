# Release notes

## [2026.10.0-port.47] - 2026-10-31

- Fix unpackaged startup by constructing the empty main-window and shell-page roots without loading missing standalone XAML resources.
- Add launch-time and 12-hour automatic update checks plus a Settings update action, using the same confirmation dialog for both.
- Download architecture-matched GitHub installers, verify size and SHA-256 metadata, and perform silent per-user updates with automatic app restart.

## [2026.10.0-port.46] - 2026-10-31

- Restore the per-user Inno Setup installer EXE for x64 and ARM64, and return the WinUI project to unpackaged self-contained deployment. Remove the MSIX signing and certificate-trust requirement; GitHub Actions now publishes architecture-specific installer EXEs.
